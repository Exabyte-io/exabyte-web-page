                        <h3>Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3>
                        <p>
                        Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        You may be asked to provide your personal information anytime you are in contact with Exabyte or an affiliate. Exabyte and its affiliates may share this personal information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy. We also reserve the right to combine and compare this information to provide and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Here are some examples of the types of personal information Exabyte may collect and how we may use it.
                        </p>

                        <h3>What personal information we collect</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>When user creates a profile and registers to use our products, purchases a product, downloads a software update, books a tour with a registered Guide, or participates in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including users name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, credit card information and usage information.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>When users share content with family and friends or invite others to join them for Exabyte activities, Exabyte may collect the information users provide about those people such as name, mailing address, email address, and phone number.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>How Exabyte may use its clients personal information</h3>
                        <ul>
                          <li>The personal information we collect allows us to keep users posted on latest product announcements, software updates and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising. If users don't want to be on our mailing list, they can opt out anytime by updating their preferences and settings.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar promotion we may use the information you provide to administer those programs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information</h3>
                        <p>
                          We also collect non-personal information, which is defined as data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose. The following are some examples of non-personal information that we collect and how we may use it:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>We may collect information such as occupation, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, location, and the time zone where an Exabyte product is used so that we can better understand customer behavior and improve our products, services, and advertising.</li>
                          <br>
                          <li>We also may collect information regarding customer activities on our website, mobile application, and from our other products and services. This information is aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered non-personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                          If we do combine non-personal information with personal information the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Exabyte may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Disclosure to Third Parties and Service Providers</h3>
                        <p>
                          At times Exabyte may make certain personal information available to strategic partners that work with Exabyte to provide products and services, or that help Exabyte to market to customers. Personal information will only be shared by Exabyte to provide or improve our products, services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These companies are obligated to protect your information and may be located wherever Exabyte operates.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Others</h3>
                        <p>
                          It may be necessary - by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence - for Exabyte to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Protection of Personal Information</h3>
                        <p>
                          Exabyte takes precautions - including administrative, technical, and physical measures - to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Integrity and Retention of Personal Information</h3>
                        <p>
                          Exabyte makes it easy for you to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date. We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Access to Personal Information</h3>
                        <p>
                          You can help ensure that your contact information and preferences are accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your account. For other personal information, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access so you can request that we correct the data if it is inaccurate or delete the data if Exabyte is not required to retain it by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, are extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required by local law. Access, correction, or deletion requests can be made to the regional Privacy email addresses.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Children</h3>
                        <p>
                          We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Third-Party Sites and Services</h3>
                        <p>
                          Exabyte websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.
                        </p>

                        <h3>International Users</h3>
                        <p>
                          Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities around the world as described in this Privacy Policy. Exabyte abides by the "safe harbor" framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information collected by organizations in the European Economic Area and Switzerland.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy</h3>
                        <p>
                          To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Exabyte employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
                        </p>
